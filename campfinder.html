    <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
    <p>
      While I was a student at General Assembly, I completed a 3 day design challenge that solved a problem for a specific user. My user was Jamison, an active, outdoor-loving designer living in Northern California. The problem he faced was that he loved to spend his weekends camping, but he was never able to get a site reservation as they always booked up months in advance.
  ​   <br><br>
      I designed a mobile application that notified campers of any last minute spots that opened up due to cancellations and allowed them to quickly and easily book the campsite spot.

    <h1>THE VISION</h1>
    <p>
      Create an app that allowed users to book campsite spaces that open up at the last minute due to cancellations. Optimize the checkout flow so users can purchase quickly and efficiently.
    </p>
  </div>

  <hr>

  <div class="framework">
    <h1>THE FRAMEWORK</h1>
    <p>
      Users wanted to quickly move through the app in order to take advantage of the cancellation spots so I decided to minimize the number of screens the user has to interact with.
    </p>

    <p>
      Users wanted to see more information about the campsite before they felt comfortable booking. Users were primarily concerned with an overview, pictures and user reviews. Originally I had designed the trip detail page to just contain an overview with additional images available as the user swipes, but in testing users found this confusing. I decided to change to a tab menu with options for campsite information, photos and reviews which made it easier for users to find the content they were looking for and continue with their purchase.
    </p>

    <p>
      I then began creating digital wireframes and performing more usability testing. During this round of testing, I learned that users can sometimes forget which credit cards are which based on the last 4 digits alone. I decided to include labels and icons that can be customized based on color eliminates the confusion for the users and makes the checkout process much simpler and quick for the user.

  <div class="design">
    <h1>THE DESIGN</h1>
    <p>
      I designed a purchasing flow for the primary persona, Jamison. Jamison lives in San Francisco and would love the opportunity to go camping every weekend - but the campsites are always reserved months in advance. He signs up to Campfinder in order to take advantage of last minute campsite cancellations.

    <h2>Key Information at Your Fingertips</h2>
    <hr size="30px" class="line">
    <p>
      Jamison receives a push notification from Campfinder to let him know there is a campsite availability next weekend. He is able to easily click on the notification and launch the app.
        <br><br>
      It was important for the users to be able to see key campsite information, peer reviews and crisp, clear campsite images so I decided to make these easily accessible for Jamison through a tab menu on the campsite detail landing page.

  <hr size="30px" class="line">
  <p>
    On the booking page, Jamison is able to easily toggle between the number of days he wishes to book. I decided to include a progress indicator bar so the user knows exactly how far along in the process they are, every step of the way.

  <h2>Add a Payment Quickly and Easily</h2>
  <hr size="30px" class="line">
  <p>
    Jamison is then able to select from a previously saved credit card or add a new payment type.
​     <br><br>
    I decided to give the users the option to scan their credit card using their device's camera. This is a quick and easy way for the user to add a payment card. Jamison is also able to manually enter his credit card details.
